  if (timestamp < (serverTime + 1000) && (serverTime - timestamp) <= recvWindow){
    // process request
  }
  else {
    // reject request
  } It is recommended to use a small recvWindow of 5000 or less!
 Timing Security
A SIGNED endpoint also requires a parameter, timestamp, to be sent which should be the millisecond timestamp of when the request was created and sent.
An additional parameter, recvWindow, may be sent to specify the number of milliseconds after timestamp the request is valid for. If recvWindow is not sent, it defaults to 5000.
